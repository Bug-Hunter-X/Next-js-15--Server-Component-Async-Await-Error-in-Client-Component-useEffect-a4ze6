In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with `async/await` within a function passed to `useEffect` in a client component.  The issue stems from the client component attempting to access the server component's results before they're fully resolved, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  The server component function may throw an error that doesn't get handled correctly in the client component's lifecycle.  This is particularly insidious because it might only appear under certain loading conditions or with specific data.
